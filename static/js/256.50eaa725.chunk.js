However, a few words of caution are in order. First, please do not give if your desire is to be blessed through financial giving. As New Testament Church Age believers, being blessed through monetary giving is not a genuine motive that God honors. Rather, Christians should give because of our awareness that we have already been blessed with every spiritual blessing. Ephesians 1:3 says, \u201cBlessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.\u201d Giving should be done with a worshipful and thankful heart that overflows into an attitude of gratitude on account of our already existent spiritual blessings. Furthermore, please do not give to this ministry if you are not a believer. First, place your trust in Christ alone for the safekeeping of your soul and then begin to grow in knowledge of His Word. The Holy Spirit will later convict of your privilege to give to support God\u2019s work. It also should be understood that you cannot earn salvation through financial giving. Faith alone in Christ alone saves and giving is the privilege of the child of God who has already been born again by the Spirit of God. Finally, if you are not a member or regular attender of Sugar Land Bible Church and are still blessed by this ministry resulting in a desire to give to it, we would ask that you give first to support your own home church. After giving to your own local church, or if you do not have a church home of your own, we welcome your financial giving to Sugar Land Bible Church."})}),(0,f.jsx)(s.Z,{xs:12,lg:12,className:"text-center",children:(0,f.jsx)(u.Z,{src:e[0],className:"py-5 pill-cursor",onClick:function(){return t()}})})]})}),(0,f.jsx)(o.Z,{fluid:!0,className:"m-0 p-0 h-15"})]})}},4158:function(e,t,i){var n={"./Give-Button.png":2052};function r(e){var t=o(e);return i(t)}function o(e){if(!i.o(n,e)){var t=new Error("Cannot find module '"+e+"'");throw t.code="MODULE_NOT_FOUND",t}return n[e]}r.keys=function(){return Object.keys(n)},r.resolve=o,e.exports=r,r.id=4158},2052:function(e,t,i){"use strict";e.exports=i.p+"static/media/Give-Button.4335f1ffd3428c0d73f9.png"}}]);
